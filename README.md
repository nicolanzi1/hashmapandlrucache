# hashmapandlrucache

I implemented my own HashMap methods to:

- Be able to describe the characteristics of a good hashing function
- Be able to explain how a linked list works and know how to traverse it
- Be able to explain how a hash map works
- Know how to implement an LRU cache using hash maps and linked lists
